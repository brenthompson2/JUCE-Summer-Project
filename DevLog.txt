    1) "SaveAs" Programs 
      (editing and playing = two different activities) 
      (Virtual Processing modules joined on screen with virtual patch cables)
      - SynthEdit by Jeff McClintock
      - SynthMaker by Outsim
      ("Plug‑in authors who use them are dependent on the developers of the software in terms of the code 
      framework — the exported plug‑ins are really just a bundled‑up 'runtime' and preset in a VST wrapper —
      so if there's ever a problem that requires technical support, there are some very real limitations 
      to what the plug‑in author can address on their own")
    2) Cockos Reaper + JS Language
      ("Basically, JS takes care of all the basic audio and user‑interface stuff for you, freeing you to 
      concentrate on writing your audio and MIDI processing in what they describe as a "C‑like language”, 
      without having to do the grunt‑work of getting it to interface with your host and its plug‑in architecture.")
    
 
 - Researching different development methods:
      - JUCE: http://www.olilarkin.co.uk/html/ftv2blank.png
          - Free personal version
          - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Pm-WP4fv0k
      - C++ and WDL-OL Library ("Whittle") and IPlug     ****Favorite So Far***
          - http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/articles/audio-plugins-001-introduction/
          - Windows Machine + Visual Studio 2010 or later
      - Need software to test-host VST2 and VST3 plugins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWitp7EOWVA
        - VSTHost for VST2 and Steinberg VST Test Host for VST3
     - Comparisons:
