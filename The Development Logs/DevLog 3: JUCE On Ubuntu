Development Log 3: JUCE on Ubuntu

- Overview ---

This third log details my experience installing JUCE on Ubuntu and trying to get my first plugin to build and run

07/20/17

Summary:
	- Researched JUCE on Linux
Thoughts:
 	- This looks super familiar and easy
 	- I am already comfortable with g++ and Makefiles

- JUCE on Linux:
  - Option 1: https://forum.juce.com/t/list-of-juce-dependencies-under-linux/15121
  	- Started Jan 2011
  	- June 21st 2017 = Most recent working bash script to install everything:
  	"
  		apt-get install clang freeglut3-dev g++ libasound2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libfreetype6-dev libjack-jackd2-dev libx11-dev libxcomposite-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev mesa-common-dev webkit2gtk-4.0
		cd JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds/LinuxMakefile
		make CXX=clang++ -j4 
	"
  - Option 2: https://forum.juce.com/t/easy-juce-installation-on-ubuntu-linux-16-04/18159
  	- June 2016
  	- One big script that installs all dependencies
  	- Creates desktop shortcuts, does stuff with file types, and all sorts of stuff

- Opening the repository on Ubuntu and merging
	- cd ../../media/bren/DATA/Brendan/Documents/2017\ Summer\ Project/VST\ Synthesizer\ Design
	- git pull
		- "Aborting: Stash or Merge Changes"
	- git stash
		- stash away changes onto a stack
	- git pull
	- git stash pop
		- pop changes back off the stack
	- git reset --hard
		- delete changes

- Running the bash script from Option 1
	- create JUCEInstaller.sh
	- paste the code & save
	- navigate terminal to file
	- sudo JUCEInstaller.sh
	- Error while changing directory causes missing makefile: 
		2: cd: JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds/LinuxMakefile: No such file or directory
		make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
		- no new files appeared in this directory
		- Perhaps JUCE was installed elsewhere?
			- Not in: $:, ../media/bren/OS:, ""/DATA:, or Computer
		- There is a .../JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds/LinuxMakefile/Makefile in the juce-huckleberry-windows folder from Windows
	- I am going to attempt to run the script #minus the first line# in the directory where it hits that Makefile...
		- It appears to be compiling tons of .cpp files...
		- and finished with: Linking Projucer - App
		- now what?
	- I don't think the dependancy installer script downloaded the actual JUCE files
		- https://forum.juce.com/t/juce-4-2-1-setup-on-apt-based-linux-ubuntu-16-04-Its-mint-elementary-os-freya/17164
		- Install instructions:
			1) Install Ubuntu
			2) Install the dependencies using the script
			3) Install the VST SDK from https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html
			4) Download and Install JUCE Linux distribution from https://www.juce.com/get-juce
	
- Actually Installing JUCE on Ubuntu
	1) Download JUCE from their website:
		- https://www.juce.com/get-juce/download
		- not the github:
			- https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE
	2) Make JUCE and install dependencies, both using the latest script
		- https://forum.juce.com/t/list-of-juce-dependencies-under-linux/15121/29
	3) Add the steinberg VST3 SDK
		- download the folder from Steinberg
		- create a folder called SDKs in your home directory 
			- has to be here 
		- Copy VST3 SDK from steinberg to the SDKs directory
			- ~/SDKs/VST3 SDK/
			- "This is one of the configuration rules for JUCE to facilitate cross platform configuration compatibility in Projucer"

- Run the projucer
	- double click on the projucer icon in JUCE directory and it opens and
	- it wants an internet connection

- Checking out the JUCE demo project
	- Compile and Link JUCE demo
		- open JUCE/examples/Demo/Builds/LinuxMakefile in terminal
		- make
	- Launch the plugin using the icon ""/build/juceDemo
