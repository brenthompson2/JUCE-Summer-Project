Summary:
	- Researched Advanced C++ techniques and started taking notes on an online book
	- Followed along with a youtube tutorial
	- Played around with the basic file structure
Thoughts:
	- I am so excited to finally start getting things off the ground!

- Researched Advanced C++ Topics:
	- Website cplusplus.bordoon.com/cplusplusadvice.html
	- Online textbook "Tips and Tricks of the C++ Professionals" from www.bordoon.com/book/index.html
- Let's Code!
- I am going to start by following along with the 6th tutorial by The Audio Programmer
	- This was the last tutorial in the series, some decent beginner work, but I still don't know anything about manipulating the Audio Buffer
